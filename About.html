          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>The impetus for this project came one night as I was talking with my friend about what patterns in districts you could notice if it were possible to scroll through the state's history. With the help of some truly incredible people, that dream is here.</p>
          <p>I must first extend a thank you to Professor Jeff Lewis and his <a href="http://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/">incredible work</a> generating shapefiles for every congressional district in history. Without his work, none of this site would be possible.</p>
          <p>As part of this credit, I also must thank Professor Ken Martis, who published in the 1980s a first-of-its-kind atlas of United States congressional districts through American history, and whose work paved the way for any subsequent research.</p>
          <p>From my own development, I must also thank two specific Northeastern University faculty members. Professor <a href="http://www.cameronblevins.org/">Cameron Blevins</a> served as my faculty advisor while I completed this project as my senior capstone, and his guidance was unparalleled in its clarity, encouragement, and helpfulness. This Project would not be here without his willingness to help me on my journey.</p>
          <p>I also must thank <a href="http://www.stevengbraun.com/">Steven Braun</a> of the Northeastern University Data Visualization Group, whose experience with D3.js and willingness to guide my code was as needed as the actual code itself.</p>
