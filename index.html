        <p>Hello and welcome to the Redistricting Visualization Project! This project was started after a very simple thought: what if you could scroll through a state's history to view how its congressional districts have changed over time.</p>
        <p>Below, you can select one of the four currently available states and do exactly that. As part of the Visualizer, you will also find two cards to better understand that map's story. In the first card, you will find simple stats for the displayed map. On the second card, you will find short explainers about what went into that map's redistricting, whether it was simple legislation, district court lawsuit, or the result of a national shift in redistricting.</p>

        <p>Below, you can select one of the tiles and read more about the history of redistricting in the United States. "Overview of Redistricting" is written to provide a surface level understanding of the redistricting process and gerrymandering in the United States. "The History of Judicial Redistricting" examines the impact that the Supreme Court and the Voting Rights Act have had on redistricting. "The Gaps in the Efficiency Gap" discusses some of the potential shortcomings and consequences of measuring partisan gerrymandering. The first two articles are published, although the Efficiency Gap article is forthcoming within the next week.</p>
