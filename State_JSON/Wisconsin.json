Simultaneously, the Governor of Wisconsin convened a special session of the legislature to try and resolve the redistricting issue legislatively, rather than in the courts.

Zimmerman</em></a>. Ruling that they did not have enough clarity by the Supreme Court for what would constitute fair districts, and so declining to redraw the districts, they ended the opinion saying that they expected to receive such clarification within the next two terms. With no new districts in place from either the state legislature or the court, the election of 1962 took place with the lines drawn in 1931.
