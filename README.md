# Redistricting Visualization Project
Visualizing congressional redistricting through American history. This project covers two main perspectives. First is the visualizer itself, where users can scroll through a state's history and view how the state's congressional districts have changed. 

The maps come from Jeff Lewis's [congressional-district-boundries](https://github.com/JeffreyBLewis/congressional-district-boundaries) project. 

Second is the (forthcoming) articles about redistricting in the United States as a whole, how it happens, and concerns for the future.


## Getting Started

You can view the project at imckdonnelly.github.io/redistricting-visualization-project. A new url should be forthcoming.

## To Do

Still to do:
* Write Efficiency Gap and Proportional Representation articles
* Fix the centering issue for Massachusetts maps pre-1820 and North Carolina first map
* Fix bug where extra tick marks are generated for some states after viewing a state with more maps
* Make the date chooser for different states more mobile friendly

## Built With

* Primarily this project uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery. 
* The map rendering has been completed with Mike Bostock's [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3).
